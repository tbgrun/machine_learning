# Overview in Supervised Machine Learning with Classifiers
Supervised machine learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where the target variable is known. The goal is to predict the target variable for unseen data.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Requirements
#### 1.1 Labeled Data
Supervised learning requires a dataset with input features (X) and a target variable (y). For classification tasks, the target variable should be categorical.
#### 1.2 No Missing Values (NaN)
Machine learning algorithms do not handle missing values well, they need to be eliminated:
  - **Removing** rows or columns with missing values.
  - **Imputing** missing values using techniques like mean, median, mode, or more advanced methods like KNN imputation.
#### 1.3 Balanced Data
For classification, it's important to have a balanced dataset, where each class is equally represented. If the dataset is imbalanced, use a stratified approach in the model, or use:
  - **Resampling techniques:** Over-sampling the minority class (e.g., SMOTE) or under-sampling the majority class.
  - **Adjusting model evaluation metrics:** Metrics like accuracy might be misleading with imbalanced data, so metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC are more appropriate.
#### 1.4 Normalized/Standardized Data
  - **Normalization:** Scaling features to a range, typically [0,1].
  - **Standardization:** Centering features around mean 0 with standard deviation 1.
  - **When to normalize/standardize:** Algorithms like k-NN, SVM, and neural networks benefit from normalization/standardization, whereas tree-based methods like Random Forest or Decision Trees generally don't require it.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### 2.1.	Descriptive Statistics
  - **Summary statistics** like mean, median, mode, variance, skewness, and kurtosis for numerical features.
  - **Frequency counts** for categorical features.
#### 2.2.	Data Visualization
  - **Univariate Analysis:** Histograms, box plots, and density plots to understand the distribution of individual features.
  - **Bivariate Analysis:** Scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices to identify relationships between features.
  - **Multivariate Analysis:** Techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to understand the relationships between multiple features.
#### 2.3.	Identifying Outliers
  - **Box plots**
  - **z-scores**
#### 2.4.	Correlation Analysis
  - **Correlation** matrices to identify multicollinearity between features.
  - **Heatmaps** to visualize correlations.
  - **Note:** For highly correlated features, consider removing one to reduce multicollinearity.

### 3. Data Cleaning
#### 3.1.	Handling Missing Data
  - **Remove**: Drop rows or columns with a high percentage of missing values.
  - **Impute:** Replace missing values with statistical measures like mean, median, or mode, or use more advanced techniques like KNN or MICE imputation.
#### 3.2.	Outlier Treatment
  - **Removal:** Remove extreme outliers if they are due to data entry errors.
  - **Transformation:** Apply transformations like log, square root, or box-cox to reduce the impact of outliers.
#### 3.3.	Encoding Categorical Variables
  - **Label Encoding:** Assign a unique number to each category (suitable for ordinal data).
  - **One-Hot Encoding:** Convert categorical variables into binary columns (suitable for nominal data).
#### 3.4.	Feature Engineering:
  - **Interaction Terms:** Create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., multiplication, division).
  - **Polynomial Features:** Create polynomial combinations of features to capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Binning:** Grouping continuous variables into discrete bins.

### 4. Choosing the Correct Model
#### 4.1.	Logistic Regression
  - **Use case:** When the relationship between the features and the target variable is approximately linear.
  - **Pros:** Simple to implement, interpretable coefficients.
  - **Cons:** Assumes linearity, sensitive to outliers.
#### 4.2.	Decision Trees
  - **Use case:** When you need an interpretable model that can capture non-linear relationships.
  - **Pros:** Easy to interpret, handles both numerical and categorical data.
  - **Cons:** Prone to overfitting, especially with deep trees.
#### 4.3.	Random Forest
  - **Use case:** When you need a robust, high-performance model that handles non-linear relationships.
  - **Pros:** Reduces overfitting by averaging multiple trees, handles missing data well.
  - **Cons:** Less interpretable, computationally expensive.
#### 4.4.	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - **Use case:** When your data has clear margins of separation between classes.
  - **Pros:** Effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust to overfitting with proper regularization.
  - **Cons:** Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
#### 4.5.	k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - **Use case:** When you have a small dataset and don't require interpretability.
  - **Pros:** Simple, no training phase.
  - **Cons:** Sensitive to noisy data, computationally expensive during prediction.
#### 4.6.	Naive Bayes
  - **Use case:** When your features are independent, or in text classification problems.
  - **Pros:** Fast, works well with small datasets and text data.
  - **Cons:** Assumes feature independence, which is often unrealistic.
#### 4.7.	Ensemble Methods
  - **Bagging** (e.g., Random Forest): Combines multiple weak models (like decision trees) to reduce variance.
  - **Boosting** (e.g., AdaBoost, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting): Focuses on correcting the errors of previous models by adding models sequentially.
  - **Stacking:** Combines multiple models by training a meta-model on the predictions of the base models.
  - **Use case:** When you need to improve model performance by combining the strengths of multiple models. Pros: Often leads to superior performance, reduces bias or variance depending on the method. Cons: Complex, harder to interpret.

5. Model Training
1.	Splitting the Data:
o	Training Set: 70-80% of the data for training the model.
o	Validation Set: 10-15% of the data for tuning hyperparameters.
o	Test Set: 10-15% of the data for evaluating the model's final performance.
2.	Model Training:
o	Fit the model on the training data.
o	Use cross-validation (e.g., k-fold cross-validation) to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
o	Tune hyperparameters using Grid Search or Random Search on the validation set.
3.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
o	Use methods like Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization to find the best hyperparameters.
o	Evaluate each combination using cross-validation.
